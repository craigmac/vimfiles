  " LIMITATIONS:
  " * Currently limited to only parsing the first found foo#bar on a line, how
  " to get around this is complicated and would need to parse where cursor was
  " and more to figure out which jump we are trying to make.
  " * if the folder name has '.vim' in it the gf command gets confused, for
  " example fzf folder is called 'fzf.vim' so it tries to edit that and just
  " open netrw at that directory when we really wanted fzf.vim/plugin/fzf.vim
  " to open. This is harcoded gf behaviour,Â the only way around this is remap
  " gf to my own Gf() function to only consider filenames jumpable and ignore
  " directories with the same name as the file.
